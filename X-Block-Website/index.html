  <h2> What are some ways that humans are harming or destroying access to clean, potable water?
</h2>
<br>
<h6> There are so many ways that humans are destroying clean water. I will show you three major ways. </h6>
<br>
 <ol>
  <li> Rapid Urban Development </li>
  <li> Throwing of Plastics in the Ocean </li>
  <li> Use of Toxic Chemicals for the Plants </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li> With Rapid Urban Delvelopment happens when homes dump chemicals or detergents down toilets. Those can lead to wastewater from highway runoff. After it gets to the highway runoff, rain can make these chemicals flow into drains and rivers. Also in theory, Sewage contains a natural substance that can be broken down by the environment easily. 90% of sewage contains water. However, in practice, sewage contains all other chemicals such as paper, plastic, and pharmaceutical products that they flush in the toilet. </li>
<br>
<li> Today, Plastic is used in almost any manufactured object, from the clothes we wear, home items, and automobile parts. It is lightweight, and it floats easily. However, plastics are non-biodegradable, and they can affect the survival of marine life for a very long time. Some people may say that plastics are not as poisonous as other chemicals, but they also present danger to the fishes, seabirds, and other marine animals.</li>
<br>
<li> When the Toxic Chemicals (harmful fertilizers) are used by farmers, they're motive is to produce more and cope with the growing population's demands. But when they do that, a algal bloom comes into the water. When the oxygen level of the water increases, it can cause the extinction of underwater plants and fish.

  <h1> Solutions to these problems -> </h1>
 <br>
  <ol>
  <li> A way we can solve Rapid Urban Development is to be careful what you put in your toilets especially if it is detergent, chemicals, paper, plastic, etc. These need to be put in the right place for disposal. This will help people from getting sick and even death. </li>
  <br>
  <li> Another problem is Throwing Plastics in the Ocean. As said, plastics are NOT biodegrable meaning that it doesn't deteriate fast. Plastics decompose in 20 to 500 years in fact. How to solve this, is not to throw away plastic. Even better don't use plastic products! Use products that can decompose quick or bring your own bag next time you shop! </li>
  <br>
  <li> The last major issue, I have listed is the The use of Toxic Chemicals for Plants. When farmers put Harmful Fertilizers on their plants to discourage pests it actually creates a algal bloom. That can cause the extinction of underwater plants and fish. To help this problem, When choosing fertilizer, opt for organic and slow-release options and apply according to the instructions on the bag. Using excess creates algal blooms which people can easily die from. </li>
  </ol>
