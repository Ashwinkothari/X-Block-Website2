  <h2> What are some ways that humans are harming or destroying access to clean, potable water?
</h2>
<br>
<h6> There are so many ways that humans are destroying clean water. I will show you three major ways. </h6>
<br>
 <ol>
  <li> Rapid Urban Development </li>
  <li> Improper Sewage Disposal </li>
  <li> Use of Toxic Chemicals for the Plants </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li> We can solve Rapid Urban Delvelopment by not dumping chemicals or detergents down toilets. Those can lead to wastewater from highway runoff. After it gets to the highway runoff, rain can make these chemicals flow into drains and rivers.</li>
<br>
<li> Having Improper Sewage Disposal can kill adults and children from water-related diseases. In theory, sewage contains a natural substance that can be broken down by the environment easily. 90% of sewage contains water. But in sewage, it could contain other chemicals like paper, plastic, and pharmaceutical products. So we can solve this by having, "Correct" Sewage Disposal and save adults and children from death. </li>

  <h1> A Famous Composer: Louis Armstrong! </h1>
  <p> Louis Daniel Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed "Satchmo", "Satch", and "Pops", was an American trumpeter and vocalist. He was among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades and several eras in the history of jazz. He received numerous accolades including the Grammy Award for Best Male Vocal Performance for Hello, Dolly! in 1965, as well as a posthumous win for the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972, and the induction into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame in 2017.</p>
